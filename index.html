            <p>Welcome to the official site assembled by NOTORIEX LEGACY! A group name created from 2016! This was a website created on March 14, 2020! We used to have another website in the past but "died" due to lack of views, content, and how it was not sufficiently official. For now, we hope you enjoy our content! Also, functionality is limited on new Google Sites which makes it difficult for our design to be improved.</p>
